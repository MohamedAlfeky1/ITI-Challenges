In this course, I learned the following database fundamentals:

- **DBMS concepts and basics**  
  Understanding the core principles and functions of Database Management Systems (DBMS).

- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**  
  Learning how to create and interpret ERDs to visually represent data structures and relationships.

- **ERD mapping to tables**  
  Translating ERDs into relational database tables and defining keys and relationships.

- **Structured Query Language (SQL)**  
  Gaining practical knowledge in using SQL for database management.

- **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**  
  Practicing DML statements like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` for data handling.

- **SQL – other database objects**  
  Exploring additional SQL objects such as views, indexes, procedures, and triggers.

- **Normalization rules**  
  Studying the rules and steps for database normalization to ensure efficiency and eliminate redundancy.

- **Database models and components**  
  Reviewing various database models (hierarchical, relational, etc.) and understanding their components.

These essential topics have helped me build a strong foundation in database design, implementation, and management.
